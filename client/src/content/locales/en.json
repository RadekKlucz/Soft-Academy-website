    "answers": {
      "a1": "Color analysis is not just about identifying a season and subtype—it’s a comprehensive process of creating an individual color palette that best harmonizes with the natural tones of your skin, hair, and eyes. With the analysis, you’ll discover which palette accentuates your natural beauty and which might make you look tired or older.",
      "a2": "For the analysis, send several photos taken in natural daylight, against a white background, without makeup, jewelry, or glasses. If you dye your hair, wait until regrowth is visible. Hold up color samples near your face—they can be your clothes, towels, bedding, or family members’ garments; the important part is to showcase a full range of basic colors.",
      "a3": "You will receive results within up to 10 business days. If you choose the comprehensive color analysis package, you’ll also have the opportunity to discuss your results during a 30‑minute consultation.",
      "a4": "Both formats have their advantages, but online analysis undoubtedly wins in terms of time efficiency. You don’t need to take a day off or travel for hours to find out which colors suit you best. I only need a few of your photos to determine your color palette with the same level of precision. Moreover, atmospheric conditions, time of day, and season can influence the outcome—online analysis provides more consistent conditions and thus greater accuracy.",
      "a5": "Very little. You’ll complete a brief form answering questions about your features and favorite or avoided colors, and send some photos of your face with different color samples—and that’s it.",
      "a6": "Absolutely! Color analysis is just as beneficial for men as it is for women. Men’s color palettes tend to be more muted. The analysis helps select suitable colors for suits, shirts, sweaters, and other wardrobe items, resulting in a more professional and appealing look.",
      "a7": "Depending on the package you choose, you may receive additional benefits such as a follow‑up consultation or a custom keychain to help avoid poor color choices when shopping. Every package includes a personalized report with your palette and styling, makeup, and accessory recommendations.",
      "a8": "Color analysis is a lifelong investment—you do it once and enjoy it forever. Beauty type doesn’t change with age. While your appearance may soften with graying hair, you won’t become the opposite type. That’s why investing makes sense—to enjoy harmonious shopping, styling, and hair color decisions for years to come.",
      "a9": "It can happen that your favorite color belongs to your opposite type’s palette—meaning it may not suit you. I’ve had the same experience with light blue. But remember: this analysis is a report with <strong>objective</strong> advice on what suits you best. You don’t have to give up your beloved colors or force yourself to wear colors you don’t like.",
      "a10": "Certainly! Bringing another person grants both of you a 10% discount on the analysis.",
      "a11": "Absolutely not. Color analysis or determining your beauty type is not about asking 'who do I resemble?' but 'which colors suit me?'. Numerous factors determine beauty type; two nearly identical individuals might receive different results due to subtle traits or undertones not obvious at first glance.",
      "a12": "When you submit the form, you will choose your preferred method of contact. Once I receive your message by email, I will get in touch with you using the contact method you selected. Then, I will send you a questionnaire about your beauty features along with instructions on how to take your photos."
